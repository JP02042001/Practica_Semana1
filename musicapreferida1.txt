BOYS DON´T CRY - THE CURE
Don't say what you mean
You might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd
You won't leave any trace
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train
It won't take long to learn
The new smile
You have to adapt
Or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
Your jumping someone else's train
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore
Now your back in line…
BOYS DON´T CRY - THE CURE
